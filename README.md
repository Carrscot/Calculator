# Calculator

For this Odin Project assignment I will be Creating A functioning calculator with a visual interface.
This will be done in several stages begining with pseudocoding then programming relevant functions, creating the user interface and finally connecting the UI with the relevant functions.



1) Functions
  a) Create basic mathematical functions - add, subtract, multiply, divide
  b) create operate function which takes an operator and 2 numbers and calls the previous functions


2) UI
  a) on click >>> return button.id and display >>> hold that return in a variable >>> concant with next click


3) Linking
  a) Figure out how to store the number as a variable after an operator has been clicked >>> try using an array or object method?? xxx
											 >>> Object [ num1: X , num2: y] then use this.num1 'operator' this.num2??? xxx
											 >>> store using toString <<<<
